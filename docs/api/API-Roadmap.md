# API Roadmap

Here is the current roadmap for features that I would *like* to implement. This doesn't mean these features are 
guaranteed to be implemented in the given version, or at all. If you would like to request a feature, join my Discord
server and create a feature request ticket. Alternatively, you could create an issue with the feature request template.

## 1.8
- Walking paths (A list of locations to "teleport" the NPC to)
- Multiple data storage options, (Databases, file, etc.)
  - Along with this, NPC data will likely shift from YAML to json
- A pose editor
- A bunch of qol and small tweaks to make using the plugin better

## 1.9
- Goal based AI
- Generic pathfinding
- "Keyframed" walking. 
  - The idea here is to have a set of points or "keyframes" for the NPC to navigate in between, using its own pathfinding
to fill in the gaps.
- Adding the ability to damage the NPCs (and knock back) would probably fit in well with the theme of this update.
