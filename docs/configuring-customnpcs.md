# Configuring CustomNPCs

CustomNPCs offers a wide range of configuration options, allowing you to tailor the behavior, appearance, and
functionality of your NPCs to suit your server's unique needs. In this section, we'll explore the key configuration
aspects and how to make the most of them. 

## General Configuration
The primary configuration file for CustomNPCs is named "config.yml" and can be found in your server's 
"plugins/CustomNPCs" folder. You can modify this file using a text editor to customize various aspects of the plugin. 
Some configurable options are: 
- Preset NPC skins
- <tooltip term="Interactable Hologram">Interactable hologram</tooltip> text
- <tooltip term="Interactable Hologram">Interactable hologram</tooltip> visibility
- Update Alerts

## Default Configurations
CustomNPCs includes default configurations that serve as a starting point for your server. You can modify these defaults
to match your preferences or create entirely new configurations to suit specific areas of your server.
