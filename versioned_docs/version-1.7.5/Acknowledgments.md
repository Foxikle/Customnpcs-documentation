# Acknowledgements
Thank you for being a part of the CustomNPCs journey. Your support and dedication are deeply appreciated. It makes my
day knowing that you chose my plugin to use. I appreciate everyone who reaches out asking for support. 

My motivation for this project fluctuates a lot, and having people genuinely interested in the project means a lot to me. As of late, I have 
had a lot of other projects to work on. People who report bugs give me a reason to work on the project, and I am grateful for that.

If you would like to support me, you can do so on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/foxikle).
